Website Navigation for signed in user

Purple indicates that the user can EDIT or DELETE the content, providing they are the owner.

Authentication was omitted from the diagram for readability. To summarise:
- The signed out Navbar offers option to SIGN IN or SIGN UP.
- Once signed in, the user can sign out in the navbar.
- A signed out user
  - cannot access messages
  - cannot see options for like or follow
  - cannot create or edit a post

Error messages from the server are caught by the frontend and displayed to the user for a seamless experience.

## 2.3. Skeleton

To make the app, `react-bootstrap` was used for an efficient workflow.

Where possible the app was designed with a mobile-first approach, ensuring that the app is responsive and accessible across devices.

### 2.3.1. UiZard Wireframe

The following UiZard wireframe was used as a starting point for the app's design:

![UiZard Wireframe - Mobile](https://res.cloudinary.com/$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$)
Mobile Design

![UiZard Wireframe](https://res.cloudinary.com/$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$)
Desktop Design

The wireframe shows the basic layout of the app, including the navbar, message list, and message detail components. The final design was based on this wireframe, with additional features and styling added to enhance the user experience.




### 2.3.2. Responsive Navbar for Mobile and Desktop

for the Navbar a desktop and mobile component was created to ensure a seamless experience across devices. Then through a hook the Navbar would switch according to screenwidth.

## 2.4. Surface

Global vars were used to efficently manage the color scheme and typography.

### 2.4.1. NavBar Design

Figma was used to create a more detailed wireframe for the app, due to time constraints certain components were focused on.

![](assets/media/2024-09-15-20-42-57.png)

### 2.4.2. Color Scheme and Typefaces with Root vars

![](assets/media/2024-09-15-20-44-48.png)

these were used to create a consistent and visually appealing design for the app, as shown in the image the variables stylesheet was used to set the color scheme and typography for the app. This provided an efficient workflow.

### 2.4.3. Light and Dark Mode with ThemeContext

Odyssey implements a dynamic theme switching feature using React Context. This system allows for seamless toggling between light and dark modes across the application. Let's dive into how this is implemented.

The theming system is primarily implemented in the `frontend/src/contexts/ThemeContext.js` file. Here's a breakdown of its key components:

### 2.4.4. ThemeContext

The `ThemeContext` is created using React's `createContext` function:

```javascript
export const ThemeContext = createContext();
```

This context will hold the current theme state and provide a method to toggle it.

### 2.4.5. ThemeProvider

The `ThemeProvider` component is responsible for managing the theme state and providing it to the rest of the application:

```javascript
export const ThemeProvider = ({ children }) => {
  const [lightMode, setLightMode] = useState(() => {
    const savedMode = localStorage.getItem('lightMode');
    return savedMode ? JSON.parse(savedMode) : false;
  });

  const applyTheme = useCallback((isLight) => {
    const root = document.documentElement;

    if (isLight) {
      root.style.setProperty('--color-background', '#FFFFFF');
      root.style.setProperty('--color-secondary-background', '#F0F0F0');
      root.style.setProperty('--color-primary-text', '#333333');
      root.style.setProperty('--color-secondary-text', '#666666');
    } else {
      root.style.setProperty('--color-background', '#121212');
      root.style.setProperty('--color-secondary-background', '#1F1F1F');
      root.style.setProperty('--color-primary-text', '#f0e7e7');
      root.style.setProperty('--color-secondary-text', '#B3B3B3');
    }
  }, []);

  useEffect(() => {
    localStorage.setItem('lightMode', JSON.stringify(lightMode));
    applyTheme(lightMode);
  }, [lightMode, applyTheme]);

  return (
    <ThemeContext.Provider value={{ lightMode, setLightMode }}>
      {children}
    </ThemeContext.Provider>
  );
};
```

Key points:
- The initial theme state is retrieved from localStorage, defaulting to dark mode if not set.
- The `applyTheme` function updates CSS custom properties based on the current theme.
- Theme changes are persisted to localStorage and applied immediately.

**useThemeTransition Hook**

This custom hook provides a way to apply theme transition effects:

```javascript
export const useThemeTransition = () => {
  return { 'data-theme-transition': true };
};
```

**Theme Application**

The theme is applied using CSS custom properties defined in `frontend/src/styles/themeTransitions.css`:

```css
[data-theme-transition] {
  transition: background-color 0.3s ease, color 0.3s ease;
}

:root {
  --color-background: #121212;
  --color-secondary-background: #1F1F1F;
  --color-primary-text: #f0e7e7;
  --color-secondary-text: #B3B3B3;
}
```

These CSS variables are dynamically updated by the `applyTheme` function in the `ThemeProvider`.

Components can access and toggle the theme using the `ThemeContext`. For example, in `frontend/src/components/NavBarDesktop.js`:

```javascript
import React, { useContext } from "react";
import { ThemeContext } from "../contexts/ThemeContext";
import { FontAwesomeIcon } from '@fortawesome/react-fontawesome';
import { faSun, faMoon } from '@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons';

const NavBarDesktop = () => {
  const { lightMode, setLightMode } = useContext(ThemeContext);

  const toggleTheme = () => {
    setLightMode(!lightMode);
  };

  return (
    // ... other nav elements ...
    <button onClick={toggleTheme} className={styles.ThemeToggle}>
      <FontAwesomeIcon icon={lightMode ? faMoon : faSun} />
    </button>
    // ... other nav elements ...
  );
};
```

</details>

This implementation allows for a seamless theme switching experience across the Odyssey application, with the current theme persisting between sessions.

# 4. **Installation**

It would be advisable to use the [Gitpod IDE](http://gitpod.io) for the installation process, as it is pre-configured with the necessary tools and dependencies, especially around `nvm` and linking to the API.

To get the frontend app up and running locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone http://github.com/lmcrean/odyssey_react.git
   ```
2. **Install dependencies**:
   Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Install correct node version**:
   Run the following command to start the React app locally:
   ```bash
   nvm install 16
   ```
4. **Run build**:
   Run the following command to build the React app locally:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
5. **Start the development server**:
   Run the following command to start the React app locally:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## 4.1. Note on compiling static files

You will need to re-run this command any time you want to deploy changes to the static files in your project, including the React code. To do this, you need to delete the existing `build` folder and rebuild it.

This command will delete the old folder and replace it with the new one: 

```bash
npm run build && rm -rf ../staticfiles/build && mv build ../staticfiles/.
```

# 5. Agile Methodology

As seperate Readme file is created to cover the Agile Methodology. 

# 6. **Acknowledgement and Credits**

## 6.1. Code Institute Moments app as boilerplate

"Moments" was used as a boilerplate for the project as it contained the necessary features for a social media platform. Both the API and the React frontend were built from this code.
  - Frontend: https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/moments
  - API:  https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/drf-api

## 6.2. Code institute Repo unification tutorial

A key issue with the project was authnetication not working on Safari browsers, due to having seperate repositories with the frontend and API. 

- [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/) provided a tutorial on how to unify the repositories, which was used to fix the issue.

## 6.5. Use of LLMs

LLMs were used as an AI tool to generate initial drafts which would be meticulously reviewed.

- writing detailed commit messages
- implementation of new features in Javascript, CSS or Python
- drafting readme documentation
- it could be assumed that any file or commit message might have started as an LLM draft which was extensively tested and reviewed.

The limits of LLMs tended to be that they could not generate test-proof code.

The following tools were used to generate such drafts:

- [Claude Sonnet 3.5](http://www.claude.ai/), eventually replacing the use of [GPT-4o](http://www.chatgpt.com/) with it's higher context window of 200,000 tokens.
- [Github Copilot](http://www.github.com/copilot) for inline editing suggestions.
