# Automated Testing in Frontend with Jest, Cypress and Playwright

# Automated Frontend Testing Results
The app includes automatic tests for core components and functionality using testing frameworks like Jest.

- To run tests, use the following command:
  ```bash
  npm test
  ```
- Tests cover components like message forms, message lists, and detail views to ensure the integrity of the app's messaging functionality.



```bash

Here's a summary of the test files and what they cover:

## Jest Summaries
| Test File | Description | Key Methodologies |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| Message.test.js | - Tests fetching and displaying the sender's username<br>- Checks error handling when fetching username fails<br>- Verifies the opening and closing of the delete modal<br>- Ensures proper rendering of message content and metadata | - Mocking API responses (axios)<br>- Rendering components with React Testing Library<br>- Simulating user interactions (fireEvent)<br>- Asynchronous testing (act, waitFor)<br>- Snapshot testing for UI consistency |
| MessageDetailSendForm.test.js | - Tests the submission of a message with an image<br>- Verifies form data handling and API call formation | - Mocking API calls (axiosReq)<br>- Form submission testing<br>- File input handling<br>- Asynchronous testing (waitFor)<br>- Checking API call parameters |
| MessageDetailSendFormAPI.test.js | - Mocks and tests the API call for sending a message with an image<br>- Verifies the structure and content of the API response | - Mocking Axios for API calls<br>- Testing API endpoint and payload<br>- Verifying response structure<br>- Handling FormData in tests |
| MessageWithImage.test.js | - Tests the rendering of a message component with an attached image<br>- Verifies the correct display of message content and image | - Rendering components with React Testing Library<br>- Mocking Context API (useCurrentUser)<br>- Asynchronous component testing (act)<br>- Testing image rendering and attributes |
| SignUpForm.test.js | - Tests the rendering of the sign-up form<br>- Checks form validation and error display<br>- Verifies form submission and redirection on success | - Rendering components with React Testing Library<br>- Mocking API calls (axios)<br>- Simulating form input and submission<br>- Testing error handling and display<br>- Checking navigation/redirection (useHistory mock) |

The most common methodologies used in testing were mocking API calls with `axios` and `jest.mock`, rendering components with `React Testing Library`, simulating user interactions with `fireEvent`, and handling asynchronous testing with `act` and `waitFor`. Asynchronous testing means that the test waits for a certain condition to be met before proceeding, ensuring that the app behaves as expected in real-world scenarios.
