# Agile Method

For this project, we will be using the Agile methodology to manage the development process. Agile is an iterative and incremental approach to software development that focuses on delivering value to the customer quickly and continuously. 

Epics, sprints and user stories are used to break down the project into manageable chunks and to track progress. There were of course many tasks and bugs in each sprint, however despite their importance they are omitted for readability. 

I will focus on the user stories that were completed in each sprint, along with their priority, as it is more relevant to the project's success and helping the reader understand the project's development process.

In this sprint, we will be deploying a functioning app with a backend API and frontend app as per the "Moments" template. This will involve setting up the backend API, creating a new model, and customising the frontend to display the new model.

The user stories below are actually from the Moments template, but they are a good starting point for our project. Later, e will need to customise the frontend to display our new model, and we will also need to create a new model for direct messages.

# Use of Kanban Boards

Todoist was chosen as the software of choice for this project, for it's appropriate simplicity and ease of use. The Kanban board was used to track the progress of each sprint, and to ensure that all user stories were completed on time. The board was updated daily to reflect the progress of each user story, and to identify any potential roadblocks or issues that needed to be addressed.
